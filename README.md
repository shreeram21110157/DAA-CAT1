Based on the accuracies alone we can conclude that Genetic algorithm comes first then comes ant colony.But this conclusion is arrived only looking at this problem of prediction the sanctioning of loans based on their details like education,income,credit card etc, We cannot use Genetic algorithm for all the problems as it may not have best solutions at all times compared to other three.Genetic algorithms is used to find the best path in a search problems, it is also used in biology,economics and scheduling purposes. Cultural algorithm is very similar to genetic algorithm as it is an modified version of it where it has beleif system where the population are divided into groups based on the beleifs.It is widely used to discover patterns of social networks and in many other fields.On the other hand PSO searches both locally and globally where genetic only searches globally.Different algorithms work and produce different results and their efficiencies will vary from problem to problem, So we we cannot say that a single algorithm is best and apply it to all the problems.We use different algorithm on different problem statements to reduce time complexity and to arrive at the solution faster .
